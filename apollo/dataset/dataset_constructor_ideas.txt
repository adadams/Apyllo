What should go into a dataset constructor?

We want a way to take simply organized information about a set of data
and construct an xarray "dataset" from it, with proper dimensions and units.

There is
    - the actual data (say, arrays of wavelengths, spectral intensity, etc.),
    - "metadata" (units, dimensions, print names, any other attributes).

One could assume the actual data comes in in arrays or similar. For the metadata,
I think we want to be pretty flexible. For example, I could have a .toml file with
entries for each component with units.

I wonder if it's "cleaner" to have a constructor of dataarrays from individual variables,
then combine them into a dataset. I actually think the native constructor for dataarrays is
pretty straightforward, and one could even have an xarray Variable as an intermediate step.
It looks like the main difference is that the Variable only specifies the name of the dim-
ension(s), whereas dataarrays actually contain coordinate data that can then be mapped onto
dimensions.

So you could require a Variable-like structure with
    (1) the data (numpy array),
    (2) the name of the coordinate/dimension (e.g. wavelength), and
    (3) the units.

Easy!
