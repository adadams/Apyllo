(1) The model spectrum name you get at the end of a retrieval has the same filename by default
    as the down-resolved data file you get from binning and convolving via input parameter file.

(2) One has to change the compiler info when setting up on different machines/clusters (just be aware).
    Also, the compilers on the same cluster will change over time as they upgrade.

(3) If you don't remove the name of the cloud species when using cloud model 4 (PLO), you will load cloud
    files you don't need to and it might cause a memory overload.

(4) Need an update readme and/or documentation for the "stable" version! --- Can we do this partly in tandem
    with documentation for the development version?

(5) In the polynomial normalization routine, the line where the "fluxspecial" is defined to normalize the errors
    needs some sort of explanation. It might also need checking. I have *some* idea of how it works but not completely.

(6) The code to define wavei/wavef in calculate_wavelength_limits() looks backwards. Confirm this isn't a leftover of
    the wavenumber days? (I mean, the code is working right now...)

(7) In general, being able to turn things on or off (e.g. Rayleigh scattering).

(8) Have some easily check-able opacity reference info at run-time.
